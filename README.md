## Description

This is an on-the-job ticket focused on modifying the existing codebase so that it follows accessibility standards and is optimized for search engines. 

## Modifications

Semantic elements were used in place of <div> elements to enhance search engine optimization. <alt> attributes were added to all images to follow accessibility standards. CSS selectors and properties were also consolidated to follow semantic structure. 

## Credits

Carlin Shaw assisted with consolidating CSS selectors during tutoring session.
